public static bool RaycastVoxels(Ray ray, out RaycastHit hitinfo,float distance,LayerMask mask )
Basic raycast with x,y,z values rounded to integer


public static int  FindMaterial(Vector3 voxel){
Finds a voxel type which returns a value of 0 to 8 , 8 being bedrock (cant be deleted) 
also returns -1 for there being nothing there

public static void SetVoxelType(Vector3 voxel,byte value)
same as before but setting instead of getting 

public VoxelChunk FindChunk(Vector3 pos) useful for finding which chunk you are in for doing various work
what I do is either oncollision enter or raycast hit then get collider.Transform
use this functions returned chunk to run other functions like:
chunk.AddPlant(Vector3 voxelPos, int id) id = number of a plant make sure this number is not greater than the number of plants 
chunk.HasPlant(Vector3 voxelPos) returns true if theres a plant or grass here grass is different from plants 
chunk.findPlant(Vector3 voxelPos) finds a plant near the location within 1 metre returns the id
chunk.DestroyPlant(Vector3 voxelPos) destroys the plant with id 

public VoxelChunk FindTreeChunk(Vector3 pos) this useful for finding a chunk that has a tree on it , I use a seperate chunk for trees 
Uses: raycast a tree get the collider.Transform.parent , make sure tree has collider on upmost transform then its parent will be the tree chunk

public static bool SetVoxels(Vector3 voxel,float value)
voxel = position from RaycastVoxels , 0 = full , 255 = empty
returns true if set 
public bool SetVoxel(List<Vector3> hitpoint, List<float> value)
same as above but using a list of points useful for setting lots of voxels in an area to a certain value its recommended to not do to many at once as its not optimised(Spelling?)

public static float GetVoxelsValue(Vector3 voxel)
returns the value of the voxel 

public static int GetBiome(Vector3 voxel)
returns the biome at a position 

public void SaveTerrains()
sets a bool to save terrains on threads 
way to save the terrains that were edited , terrains that have their lods changed by moving further away are save automatically 

public void SaveTerrain()
same as before but does it immediately may slow down cause lag spike possibly even a freeze

The rest of the functions are all used by the engine to do various things and will be labeled at a later date
